    <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
    <p><i>By Henry Scott-Holland</i></p>
    <p>Death is nothing at all.<br>
        It does not count.<br>
        I have only slipped away into the next room.<br>
        Nothing has happened.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Everything remains exactly as it was.<br>
        I am I, and you are you,<br>
        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.<br>
        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.<br>
    </p>
