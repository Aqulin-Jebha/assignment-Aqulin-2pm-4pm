Comparison of <div> tag and semantic Tags
    Semantic tags provide meaning to the content (like <header>, <nav>, <section>), helping with SEO, accessibility, and clearer structure. They should be used when the content has a specific purpose.
    <div> is a generic container with no meaning and should be used only for layout, styling, or grouping content when no suitable semantic tag exists.
