task 1. An error is a problem that occurs while JavaScript code is being parsed or executed.

task 2
 1.Syntax Errors
 2.Runtime Errors
 3.Logical Errors

task3
Difference between runtime and logical error
 A runtime error occurs while the program is running. The program crashes or stops execution.
 A logical error occurs when the program runs successfully, but the output is incorrect.

task 4
It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors (exceptions) so that the program doesn’t crash and can continue running safely.
try block: Contains code that may cause an error, If an error occurs, control moves to catch
catch block: Handles the error,Executes only if an error occurs in try
finally block: Always executes, Runs whether an error occurs or not, Used for cleanup (closing files, connections, etc.)

task 5
throw is used to manually generate (raise) an error/exception in a program when a specific condition occurs.
It helps you control error handling instead of waiting for the system to crash automatically.
